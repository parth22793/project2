### Provided by Harvard University (HarvardX)

* Project 2 is done by using Python, Flask, Flask-SocketIO, JavaScript, AJAX, Bootstrap.

* A user can Register in this Flack app by providing Name.

* User can Create a Channel.

* User can see available channels and join existing one to chat.

* Each ChatRoom contains its specific conversations.

* If user close the window, conversations and usernames will still exist in Session and localStorage.

* My Personal touch is - Users can send Message Privately.
